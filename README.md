##Student Grade Generator
The `grade` function takes input for marks scored by the students between 0 and 100. It then outputs the corresponding grade based on the below system:

 A > 79
 B - 60 to 79
 C -  59 to 49
 D - 40 to 49
 E - less than 40




##Speed Detector
The `detector` function evaluates a driver's speed to determine compliance with traffic regulations. It provides feedback based on the following criteria:

- **Speed Below Limit:** If the speed is less than or equal to 70 km/h, it returns "Ok".
- **Points:** For every 5 km/h above the speed limit, the driver receives one demerit point. The function calculates and returns the total points.
- **License Suspension:** If the total demerit points exceed 12, the function indicates that the driver's license is suspended.
